https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/v1.89.2/imgui.cpp#L1436
changed to:
    const ImGuiInputEvent* latest_event = nullptr;
    it would crash when i moved the mouse sometimes.

https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/v1.89.2/backends/imgui_impl_sdl.cpp#L344
changed to:
    bd->MouseCanUseGlobalState = false;
    mouse position would have been offset by a lot.
